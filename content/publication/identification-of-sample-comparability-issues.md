abstract = "Imbellus develops cognitive assessments designed to evaluate the 
skills and abilities of its users within the context of game-based 
simulations. This paper describes work from our ongoing collaboration with a
best-in-class management consulting firm, McKinsey & Company, to build a 
simulation-based assessment that evaluates applicants' cognitive skills and 
abilities. A major challenge inherent in producing a game-based cognitive 
assessment in an industry setting is to balance the need for iterative design 
improvements and the need for validation with large samples. The work 
presented here describes a four-step process for assessing the impact of a 
given design change on the comparability of pre-change and post-change 
samples. We also discuss implications and future work. "
