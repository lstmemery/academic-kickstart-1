# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = ""All models are wrong, but some are useful" is one of the most quoted phrases in data science, but how do we even know if a model is useful? This talk will introduce you to the tools used to validate models. We will also discuss the two most common challenges when it comes to validating a model: data leakage and optimization bias. All examples will be in Python3, Jupyter and Sci-Kit Learn."
