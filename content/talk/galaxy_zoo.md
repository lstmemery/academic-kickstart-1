# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "With each passing day telescopes around and above the Earth capture more and more images of distant galaxies. As better and bigger telescopes continue to collect these images, the datasets begin to explode in size. In order to better understand how the different shapes (or morphologies) of galaxies relate to the physics that create them, such images need to be sorted and classified. Kaggle has teamed up with Galaxy Zoo and Winton Capital to produce the Galaxy Challenge, where participants will help classify galaxies into categories."
